Listed in this section are descriptions of a few of the inquiries that we have written that are stable enough for you to reliably use on your data.

Discussion focuses on inquiries that can be run with DICOM-SR data only.

All of the inquiries listed are designed to work only on fluoroscopy procedures.

**To make inquiries more useful, please keep in mind** that CARE Analytics provides ways to filter your data when you import it from .SR files or query it from a DICOM node. So, for example, if you want to see your results for Average\_Fps, ModalityUsage, RoomUsage, MissingData, or FrameCount broken down by physician (or any other value in the DICOM-SR report), you can achieve that by filtering the data during the import, saving separate .xml files for each physician, and running the inquiry separately on each file.
