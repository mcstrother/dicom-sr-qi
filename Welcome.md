# Introduction #

DICOM Structured Reports (DICOM-SR) give highly granular data about radiation usage in radiographic studies and procedures.

The goals of this project are:
  * To use DICOM-SR data to drive quality improvement and patient safety initiatives at our local site, the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology.
  * To generate a set of free and open source tools that will be useful in similar initiatives at other sites.

We are currently focused on fluoroscopy, but the core of our software is easily extensible to CT and plain films.

Check out our GettingStarted page for instructions on how to run our first demo, a very simple tool which you can use to easily run some pre-defined analyses on your site's DICOM-SR data.
