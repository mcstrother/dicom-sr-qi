This inquiry plots the distribution of time that a resource is in use on a weekly basis. It does this by looking at the first fluoro event and last fluoro event of a procedure and defines the resource as "In Use" between those two.

As the name and graph labels imply, so far we have used it to plot the usage of fluoro machines at MIR, since we store data from each machine/room in separate .xml files. However, the inquiry applies equally well to any resource if you export the .xml files from CARE Analytics correctly. (See InquiryDescriptions.) For example, it could be used to get an idea of work schedules of individual physicians.
